# VBA Challenge
Project using VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project I created a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:
- The ticker symbol
- Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
- The total stock volume of the stock.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I then added functionalities to the script to return the stock with:
- Greatest % increase
- Greatest % decrease
- Greatest total volume
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I finally made the appropriate adjustments to my VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.
